Keystroke dynamics, a biometric authentication technique, has gained significant attention due to its potential for secure user identification and verification. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the type of text used in keystroke dynamics, the features extracted from the data, and the classification algorithms used. Then two algorithms are proposed, one based on metric distance to compare data with a nearest neighbor algorithm and another based on a hybrid neural network architecture that use a CNN and a RNN. The algorithms where tested with public datasets from Universities. The results, according to the literature, are an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 8.4\% for the nearest neighbor algorithm and 5.97\% for the hybrid neural network.
